# redo_NPARCfit

Re-fit melting curve of Husen Detected &conventional peptides via ALTERNATIVE MODEL (fit by each sample), get RSS and AUMC, and analyze.

**Script 1-3**: Filter Husen detected peptides & create dataset for NPARC fitting

**4_NPARC_Pepfilt.R**: Fit model and generate the result.

**5_analysis**: Analysis of RSS

**Script 5-8**: AUMC analysis, similar to RSS.
